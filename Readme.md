## Key-Features

-   **Fetch API:**  In this project I have used API to make the website dynamic.
- **Category:** When a category button is clicked it fetches the data from API and then shows the data of that pet category. Also for the category that doesn't have any data it shows a meaning full message.
-   **Active Button:** There is four button that was dynamically created by the API and when button is clicked by category it changes the style of the active button.
-   **Sort By Price Button:** There is a sort by price button when it is clicked it shows all the pets by price in descending order
-   **Spinner/Loading** When a category button is clicked it shows a spinner for two seconds then it shows the data of that category.
-   **Liked Pet:** When a like button is clicked from the pet card, it shows only that pet's picture on the side which is dynamically fetched via API 
-   **Adopt Button:** When a adopt button is clicked from the pet card, it opens a modal which has a countdown from 3 and then automatically closes after 1.
-   **Details Button:** When a details button is clicked from the pet card, it opens up a modal with all the information about that pet and a close button to close the modal
